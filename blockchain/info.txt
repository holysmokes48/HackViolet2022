The creation of the blockchain:
In simple terms, blockchain is a chain of blocks that record information in such a way that said information is impossible to be hacked, changed or manipulated.

1991 => Stuart Harber and W Scott Stornetta spoke about the possibility of a cryptographically secured chain of
blocks.

1998 => Nick Szabo, a computer scientist, started to work on a decentralised currency called "bit gold"

2000 => Stefan Konst releases an idea about cryptographically secured chains and also gives ideas for
designing and developing it

2008 => A single or group of developer(s) published a white paper putting in place a model for a blockchain.
The developer(s) were known as Satoshi Nakamoto which people believe to be a pseudonym.

2009 => Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first public ledger on a blockchain where transactions can be made.

Now => There are other popular blockchains such as Ethereum and R3 Corda.

How it works:
Most public blockchains contain these fundamental components:
- A peer-to-peer network
- Messages to declare state transitions
- A consensus algorithm (rules)
- A state machine to work with the consensus algorithm
- A chain of cryptographically secured blocks
- A incentivization scheme
- An open source implementatiom of at least one of the above components
